# React Router Dom v6 Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using React Router Dom v6.  Initial route rendering works correctly, but navigating between routes results in unexpected behavior, such as blank pages or incorrect component rendering.  The solution involves ensuring proper use of `useLocation` and other relevant hooks.

## Bug Description:

The application uses React Router Dom v6 to handle navigation between different routes.  After the initial render, navigation between routes may lead to unexpected behavior: the component at the target route might not render, an error might occur, or the wrong component might be displayed. The bug is particularly troublesome with nested routes or when using route parameters.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate between the Home and About pages.  Observe the issues after the first navigation. 

## Solution:

The solution demonstrates a method to ensure components render correctly using lifecycle methods and appropriate handling of the routing changes.
